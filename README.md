"Driverless" or autonomous Class-8 tractor-trailers (aka "big rigs" or "18-wheelers") are in development now and safely road-testing in
various states at SAE Level 4. With government sanction, they operate only on freeways and interstates with onboard, commerciallylicensed “safety” drivers.
These tractor-trailers are being tested to eventually convey freight at SAE Level 5 – safe, commercial operation (direct shipper to
receiver) without the costs and Federal Hours of Service (http://tinyurl.com/jds4yko) restrictions of human drivers.

Current Level 4 technology limits autonomous trucks from safely maneuvering in confined areas for access to docks where their freight
is loaded and/or unloaded -- the onboard driver must take control of the vehicle, backing the trailer into a dock or parking it in an
assigned space.

To reduce costs, eventually eliminate the driver and operate the vehicle completely autonomously (transcending from Level 4 to 5 when
proven safe and legal), the docking or parking procedure can be safely handled by a remote operator who is supported with drone
imaging, custom software and high-speed telecommunication.

This drone and wireless software interface to the truck allows the remote operator to identify the parking place or loading dock which the
vehicle must back into and commands the truck’s own self-driving components to safely do so. This technology is also applicable to
automobiles and smaller Class 1-7, two and three-axle trucks.

Following is the solution to handling a fully autonomous Class-8 tractor-trailer at its shipper and receiver’s location.
